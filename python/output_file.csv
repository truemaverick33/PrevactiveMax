This morning the system trys to start but it appears that the ignitor is not working.  Normally, you can hear the ignitor trying to light, but this morning you hear nothing.

"For the hood, we have made progress but still don’t have a working hood.  There is power but the hood doesn’t exhaust anything. The next step is to check the rooftop unit, but that’s a tough process for my electricians who don't know the school layout and how to get to the rooftop units.  The electrician that came out and found the burnt fuse to at least get power to the hood was Matt DiFonso 551-267-8592.  I believe he works in a department that does maintenance exclusively for city schools. He was able to fix the electrical prob with one visit.

"As I stated on the phone. We installed new domestic water piping at this location, but I did not include pipe insulation in my pricing. The DGS quality control inspector (Mike) told my guys that the pipe should be insulated and they went ahead and insulated the pipe thinking it was in the contract. As per our conversation, this caused us to go over our proposed priced to perform this job by $12,967.69.  I know that we had a conversation about the insulation while we were running the new piping and you thought we could get an extra for it. If possible please send another WR# to cover the cost for the insulation and the labor to install it.

We had cleaned up the room and removed the carpet from the leak thay had leaked for 2 years. We just replaced the carpet. Fred said it needs a new valve and the one in lobby area. Fred said it is no good and needs to be capped off. The Mayor is coming there on Saturday. Can we please get this done asap so we can have some heat with no leaking. That leak was really bad and caused some major issues, destroyed the carpet, electric light and sheetrock in that room. All that we replaced. Cant repeat that. I guess over the years school was closed they never fix the leak. Just let water run. Directly associated with the heat.

The TMC System room has critical servers and other Traffic Management System equipment that is important to the day to day operations here at the TMC Facility located at 414 N. Calvert Street. 

These equipment require constant and efficient cooling systems. We are asking for support with looking into the options of replacement of 2 current standalone Stultz air conditioning systems that recently we have been experiencing too many failures and need full replacement or major overhaul.

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Form time to time we receive complaints from staff here at the TMC regarding dust particulates accumulating on their desks. The particulates can be seen at several locations on desks throughout the second floor as well as the Chief's Office.

We do  not have the same complaints on the second floor since the spaces were renovated in 2007 and so do not believe the first floor ducts needs cleaning at this time.

REQUEST:
Please arrange for the second floor all 7 zone ducts to be cleaned at this time. Although we routinely every three months as best replace the filters the particulates are still accumulating on desks throughout the spaces.

"A quote is needed for retrofitting an underground discharge line with a tee and a standpipe that would have a compatible fitting to our 
Godwin Pump discharge lines.
When there is a pump failure at the Intermediate Pumping Station we utilize the Godwin (External) Pump to pump leachate in a tanker truck and 
haul the leachate to the leachate lagoon area and unload the leachate. This is very time consuming and sometimes leads to overtime beyond 
regular business hours. The pump and tanker are also parked on the landfill perimeter road closing one lane and possible causing a safety hazard.
The proposal/estimate should be to insert/install a tee inline to include a standpipe. When installed the pump will be able to pump continuously 
(pump is a dri-prime pump) when connected to this standpipe and only require daily preventive maintenance, fuel, etc. 
The pump will also be put in place in the Intermediate Pumping Station area and not blocking one lane on the perimeter road.

"Please supply labor and materials to get heating unit for room 154 at the Eastern Clinic. Last year, during the winter months, there was a significant leak in a radiator on the second floor (in School Health) that leaked down into our area, Rm. 154.  In the course of fixing that leak, the contractors capped off a line that led to the radiator in Rm 154, thereby making in non-functional.  So, long story short, no heat comes out of the radiator in that room.  DGS told us they would bring us some sort of heating unit to compensate (since it was a mistake that some contractor made to the line that led to that particular radiator) and they never did.  So, now that the cold is really setting in, that room is totally without heat.  Could you please follow up with general services to get a heating unit for that office?

1.It is about 90 degrees in Cat House.
2.The heat is not working in the garage.
3.There is a strange low whooshing noise that can be heard in Surgery, the supply closet and the veterinarians’ office.  This noise is consistent with when the heat kicks on.
4.Also (and possibly related to #3 above), it looks like a metal cover may have been blown off of one of the units on the roof.  Our maintenance person just went up on the roof to move it as it was very close to the edge and we are concerned that it will fall onto one of the cars parked on the back (Animal Control) lot.
5.There is a steady stream of water running from a pipe through a hose and into a floor drain in the boiler room.

To my knowledge nothing was done to it, we came in one day last week and no water was coming out.  The tall fountain is working fine.  One item to note:  We had an exterior spigot possibly bust a few weeks ago.  It was shut off (and will also need repaired before summer, located in the front flower bed to the left of the entrance behind shrubs)  Could it be possible there are two lines running into the water fountain and the non-working fountain is on the same line as the suspected broken pipe?  When the pipe broke it was not at all cold out so we are not sure why it was gushing water.

Traditionally, when requests are made, General Services sends out their people, who are not able to work on the system, because it is a bit archaic and wonky. As a result, a contractor is normally sought after to resolve issues and we've had the best experience with J.F. Fischer, Inc.

Subject: Re: Request for an Overhead Vent to be covered or partially covered.
Good afternoon,

I'll have our staff check the area.  We don't encourage covering the registers/diffusers as it interferes with balancing of the distribution system.  We may be able to make an adjustment or put a diverter on the vent.  We'll check it and then make the most efficient repair.

Subject: Request for an Overhead Vent to be covered or partially covered.
 
 
Good Afternoon,
Agent Lindsay Cooper of the OIG, 640 City Hall, has advised that her area is entirely too cold due to an overhead vent directly over her cubicle and would like to have a diverter installed.
Previously when I was in a similar location, Charlie covered the vent with a manila file folder or similar substance.  Therefore, this request is for someone with a high ladder to try to do the same, using any material applicable, to completely or partially cover the vent and hopefully alleviate the problem.
Of course, any alternative actions you recommend or suggestions you advise would be greatly appreciated.
Ms. Cooper’s phone is 443 984 3694.

"Yesterday we had the roofers out to look at various leaks.  They discovered that one of the leaks is not a roof problem, but a leaking pipe that we believe is connected to the HVAC system.  We have requested the A/C be switched over to heat last week.  Once that happens, we can also finish the draining and re-wrapping of the pipes above the stage risers that RF Warder never finished b/c they wanted to wait until they could drain the pipes.  TOMORROW (FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20TH) OUR SCHOOL IS CLOSED TO STUDENTS, but we have staff in the building.  I have several contractors doing work here tomorrow, and it would be AWESOME if you're crew (RF Warder) can come out and finish the last job and also the new leaking pipe.

Thank you,

"This is a follow-up to a prior report weeks ago. The instant water heater beneath our sink here in the Engineering Section of Suite 301 leaks. When originally reported, DGS staff could not find a leak, so they said they could not fix it. Several times since, I have advised them that the leak continues, but they have failed to find and fix the leak. We keep a large bowl beneath the unit to catch water. It continues to do so, and if we forget to empty the bowl one day, it overflows into the cabinet and onto the floor. It is my opinion that the crew should do more to find and fix the problem. We should not have to continuously monitor and empty a large bowl of water. It is pretty obvious that the problem is with the heater, as we and others have had the same situation previously. Therefore, we request that you send someone to replace or repair the unit as soon as possible.

Came in to superintendents office flooded.  DGS came out and states that is is the drain from the HVAC unit and a contractor must come up.  RF Warder came out took pictures and identified the problem which was not the HVAC drain but the drain in the flooring of the catwalk and a plumber needed to be dispatched.  DGS returned with no tools to clear the drain. John Hammock came out and put a hose in the drain but it was still backing up so the superintendent cleaned the drain.  But RF Warder did come out and do a full evaluation of the problem and spoke with MIke Jones to explain what was necessary to stop the flow of the water into the office below.  This is being to submitted to allow payment for the contractors.  Olivia 8/21/15 Assigned to R.F Warder,HVAC

"Deb,

I spoke with your tech and discussed the following work scope to be included in the aforesaid work order:
1.	 Apply 3-hr rated fire-barrier sealant/caulking (to the pipe penetration on the floor by the leaking fan-coil unit (fcu).  Doing so will contain and prevent condensate water from leaking down into the Gun Range Room. 
2.	Insulate with at least ½-inch thick fiberglass piping insulation (preferred) for chilled water piping and domestic cold water piping which are producing/leaking condensate water into the ceiling.  Such replacement of piping insulation should not exceed fifty (50) linear feet (lf) of piping insulation.  Apply vapor retardant paint over insulation seams and joints to retain vapor tightness of the insulation.  If replacement of piping insulation should exceed 50 lf, please provide us immediately your price quote for replacing the defective piping insulation.
3.	Perform preventive maintenance (PM) on the ventilation unit for the gun range and for the HVAC equipment for the 2nd floor Locker Room area.  The PM work are not limited to the following standard scope as applicable: 
a.	Replace air filters and belts (if needed/applicable) and date stamp the air-filter media frame using a permanent marker.
b.	Perform performance test by checking voltage, current, superheat, subcooling, operating pressures and temperatures, etc.  Provide us list of recommended repairs if any.  We will address deficiencies in another work order.
c.	Clean evaporator coil and condenser coil if necessary.  
d.	Check for proper operation of the condensate-water drain line and clean trap if required.  
e.	I recommend cleaning electrical contacts with electrical contact cleaner.  
f.	Check and tighten electrical connections.
4.	Provide us a couple of proposals to establish air movement for the gun range and for the other rooms in the basement for proper dehumidification and temperature control.  I suggest that one less expensive option is to have automatic temperature control by utilizing the ventilation fan in the Gun Range Room.  Check exhaust air for the room in the basement by the stairway (leading to the 2nd floor).
5.	Repair the mounting of the lavatory in the basement restroom.  If lavatory is beyond repair, please advise us and provide us a quote.
6.	The new NTE amount is $4,000.

Investigate the active leak above ceiling in range area.

"Please contact Mark Pappas or Charlie Loskarn at 396-7132 first in order to coordinate your visit to the site and enable the customer to turn off the HVAC alarm system.   Provide labor and materials to repair the refrigerant leak found in the center RTU along the E Madison Street side (front of bldg).  One of the pressure sensors for the Copper Watcher seemed to have oil stains around the threaded fittings.  Recharge the refrigerant system (410-A refrigerant) and provide DGS a start-up sheet for the servied RTU.  Provide DGS/HVAC Section a price quote to correct the wiring for the Copper Watcher for each unit on the roof.  If new wires need to be rerun in order to for proper operation of the Copper Watcher system, please include in quote.  Also, please make sure that low voltage or control wiring for the Copper Watcher is not installed in a high-voltage source such as the power disconnect for the RTU.  Richard from Stanley Security indicated that low-voltage wires found inside the power disconnect box are getting feedback from the high voltage wires.  The magnetic field produced by the high voltage wire may also be contributing to the error signal being received by the building security or fire alarm panel.  See background info from MOED about the alarm problem associated with the Copper Watcher.  Service call to determine why the ""Copper Watcher"" security system is being set off.  An alarm has been sounded on 5 seperate ocassions over the last 10 days.  Stanley/Sonitrol the security vendor has been to the scene twice and would like to meet at the site with the HVAC vendor to determine what the problem may be.  Stanly/Sonitrol feels that it may be a mechanical problem.  Please contact Mark Pappas or Charlie Loskarn at 396-7132 with the vendor's estimated arrival date and time so we can arrange for the alarm vendor to meet them at the site.

"I am still experiencing the lighting issues at Mitchell Courthouse. There have been several request made to have an electrical contractor come to assess the problem and give recommendation to alleviate these issues. Hallway lights are going out sporadically floor by floor , with shorter intervals sometimes within weeks apart. I have actually dated lights that I had to return and change twice in the same month. Every floor is affected from the 6th to the 1st. The plt 26 bulbs cost the City $7.50 per bulb each light has 2 bulbs , the ballast cost is $15.00 and change, do the math it is quite costly. The cost of the of continuing to change these bulbs is probably a lot more than getting the contractor to come and assess.

"3/11/2015 - As authorized by Stephen Stricklin, DGS will handle the repairs needed to address the control over the baseboard heaters in Mr. Braverman's Office.  A separate temperature controller was installed in Mr. Braverman's Office to control only the baseboard heaters in his office.  Before, Nadya controls the baseboard in her office and Mr. Braverman's Office as well.  Overheating has been resolved in Mr. Braverman's office before the end of February 2015. The repair was addressed by WO# 24528.   fld.

2-20-2015:  Checked and adjusted the air flow coming from each ceiling linear diffusers.  Found that the overheating problem was caused by the renovation project whereby the controls to the baseboard heaters and adjustment to the air flow rates were not incorporated on that project.  That said, the work order to separate control to Mr. Braverman's baseboard heater from Nadya's thermostat shall be generated and addressed under a different work order.  Such modification is not part of the lease agreement but will be addressed by DGS for now to establish control over the baseboard heaters and prevent overheating. The appropriate agency shall be billed for the corrective repair.  Ferdinand.


Rooms 314 (Nadya Morgan) and 315 (Michael Braverman), and the open areas adjacent to those offices seem to be experiencing an imbalance of heat/air distribution. Ms. Morgan would like to have the baseboard heaters in her and Mr. Braverman's offices fitted with additional control valves so that they may more efficiently control the heat distribution in those areas. Additionally, Mr. Braverman's office is overly warm (hot) when the controller for the ducted air is on and set to warm, while the workstations and areas outside of his and Ms. Morgan's offices are very chilly, likely due to the absence of heating units in that area of the HVAC system.
Please have someone arrange to discuss these issues in detail with Ms. Morgan and then determine what may be done to rectify the situation.

You may contact Ms. Morgan at 410-396-4661.
Thank you,

Request to evaluate sump pump in the back of the site, the sump pump is located in the room where the electrical panels are located right under pit #2. When you turn the sump pump on the sewer water is coming back out of the pump instead of the pump pumping the sewer water to the drain. When leachate water builds up between chutes # 1 and #2 we can’t turn on the sump pump to pump the water out because the sump pump is pumping water back into 
the room instead of pumping it to the sewer.  Contact Demetric Farmer on 410-396-2706.

The spout sits as the very edge of the base and renders it difficult to fix causing leaks on the floor.  Can you please send someone to assess how best we can maintain the unit or consider replacement.  Floor below is getting too saturated from the frequent occurrences and needs to be resolved.

Last year there was a group that came out and told us after they installed manual knobs on the radiators to control the heat in the room, but we have been dealing with heat in the building to 87-90 degrees. I was talking with my co-worker and told him that with heat like this in the building and there are a group of men painting in the recreation center and over on the other side of the building where St. Frances Headstart used to be there is a group painting there too. I told my co-worker that the heat and the paint don’t mix because I have notices that no one has any windows opens while painting. Yesterday I left out with a headache because of the heat and the paint. Is there any way that someone can come over and check the system or thermostat and boiler to see if the heat can be adjusted or turned down heat.
